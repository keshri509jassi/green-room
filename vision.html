            <i><b><p>A vegan diet is a part of a lifestyle that excludes the consumption or use of any products that come from animals. Some people may think this is an extreme attempt at leading a healthy lifestyle, but there are plenty of benefits that come with a vegan diet.</p></b></i><br>
            <ul>
                <li>Zero Animal Fats</li>
                <p>Consuming animal fats has been linked to a range of health conditions such as diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, hypertension, heart disease, and various forms of cancer.Healthy, plant-based oils and fats, such as olive oil, provide the necessary fatty acids we need without increasing the levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol.
                </p>
                <li>Improving Your Bone Health</li>
                <p>milk and cheese are the most popular and efficient sources of calcium. If you want to go vegan, figs, kale, spinach, black-eyed peas, and turnip greens can be ideal sources of calcium.Vegans have also shown more efficient absorption of calcium and bone metabolism, the process through which new bone tissue is formed and restored.
                </dp>
                <li>Fight Against Chronic Diseases with a Vegan Diet</li>
                <p>Chronic disease is one of the leading causes of death.plant compounds can help to control different genes linked to cardiovascular disease, arterial plaque, and tumor growth.Researchers maintain that the antioxidants in plant-based foods can combat free radical cells that cause cell damage and inflammation.
